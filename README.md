# Spam Mail Classifier

This project is a simple **Spam Mail Classifier** built using **Machine Learning**. It helps to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham** (Non-Spam) using a trained model. The model uses **Logistic Regression** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to understand and classify email content.

## What is this project about?

In this project:
- We use a machine learning model to predict whether an email is **Spam** or **Ham**.
- We preprocess the email content (text) using **TF-IDF** (a method to convert text into numbers).
- The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails.
- We built an **interactive web app** using **Streamlit** so that anyone can input email text and get an immediate prediction (Spam or Ham).
